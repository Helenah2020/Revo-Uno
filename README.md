# Revo Uno
Revo Uno is a cartesian FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer. This 3D printer is very much like the Mendel 3D printer, the simplest printer to build, except this 3D printer has a triangular metal frame consisting of a combination of square box section and circular rods instead of just circular rods like the Mendel 3D printer, the advantage of this frame is you can hide the wiring inside the square box section of the frame and force it to stay tidy and protect it from damage.

## Features
* **Bowden extrusion system:** Unlike the direct extrusion system where the drive gear and the hot end are a single unit, with the bowden extrusion system, the drive gear and the hot end are seperate units which are bridged with a feeding tube for the filament to go through.
* Cartesian coordinate system
* Metal frame consisting of a combination of box section and rods
