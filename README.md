# Revo Uno
The **Revo Uno** is a cartesian FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer. This 3D printer is very much like the Mendel 3D printer, the simplest printer to build, except this 3D printer has a triangular metal frame consisting of square hollow section which is tensioned and bolted together using threaded circular rods where as the Mendel printer has a frame consisting of only threaded rods which are bolted together, the advantage of a square hollow section frame is you can hide the wiring inside the square hollow section of the frame and force it to stay tidy, keep it hidden and protect it from damage.

## Features
* **Bowden extrusion system:** Unlike the commonly used and simpler direct extrusion system where both the cold end (stepper motor and gearing) and the hot end (heated nozzle, heatsink and thermistor) are the same part, with the bowden extrusion system, the cold end is seperate from the hot end and filament is fed to the hot end via a feeding tube which guides the filament and pushes it through the hot end.
* **Cartesian coordinate system:** Cartesian 3D printers are named after the Cartesian coordinate system that uses X, Y, and Z coordinates to plot points. This system of coordinates is used to determine the location of the print head. Cartesian 3D printers do this through a system of smooth circular rod rails and linear bearings which are used to move the print head or the print bed or a combination of both to position the nozzle anywhere in the 3D space.
* **Dual extrusion:** There is an option to add a second extruder to the printer.
* Metal frame consisting of a combination of square hollow section and rods

## List of Parts
**Screws:**\
We wanted to use pozi screwdrivers so we adopted the DIN 7985 standard for all the screws on this printer which are pozi pan head machine screws.

## Be Green
Billions of tonnes of polymer is in the environment around us. Think before you print, re-use, recycle. All polymers are dirty, even the recycling process (melting down) of polymers is dirty however one can take the care to reduce their environmental impact. The key is, produce as little waste as possible, choose wisely your polymer, if you don't have a good solid reason to print using anything but a friendlier polymer then print using a friendlier polymer. Below is a list of friendlier polymers which have a low bio-degrading time and even easy to work with reducing polymer waste.

* PLA (Polylactic Acid)
* PET (Polyethylene terephthalate)

Ideally, it would be better of polymers were compostable, fortunately there is active research in the use of compostible polymers and there is even one out there made from brown seaweed as a renewable source but unfortunately this isn't readily available anywhere yet.
