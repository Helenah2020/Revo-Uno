# Revo Uno
Revo Uno is a cartesian FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer. This 3D printer is very much like the Mendel 3D printer, the simplest printer to build, except this 3D printer has a triangular metal frame consisting of a combination of square box section which are tensioned and bolted together using threaded circular rods and smooth circular rods instead of just smooth and threaded circular rods like the Mendel 3D printer, the advantage of this frame is you can hide the wiring inside the square box section of the frame and force it to stay tidy and protect it from damage.

## Features
* **Bowden extrusion system:** Unlike the commonly used and simpler direct extrusion system where both the cold end and the hot end are the same part, with the bowden extrusion system, the cold end is seperate from the hot end and filament is fed to the hot end via a feeding tube which guides the filament and pushes it through the hot end.
* **Cartesian coordinate system:** Cartesian 3D printers are named after the Cartesian coordinate system that uses X, Y, and Z coordinates to plot points. This system of coordinates is used to determine the location of the print head. Cartesian 3D printers do this through a system of smooth circular rod rails and linear bearings which are used to move the print head or the print bed or a combination of both to position the nozzle anywhere in the 3D space.
* Metal frame consisting of a combination of box section and rods
