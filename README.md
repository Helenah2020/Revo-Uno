# Revo Uno
Revo Uno is a cartesian FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer. This 3D printer is very much like the Mendel 3D printer, the simplest printer to build, except this 3D printer has a triangular metal frame consisting of a combination of square box section and circular rods instead of just circular rods like the Mendel 3D printer, the advantage of this frame is you can hide the wiring inside the square box section of the frame and force it to stay tidy and protect it from damage.

## Features
* **Bowden extrusion system:** Unlike the direct extrusion system where the both the drive gear and the hot end are parts of the print head, with the bowden extrusion system, the drive gear is seperate from the print head and filament is fed to the print head via a feeding tube which guides the filament and pushes it through the print head.
* **Cartesian coordinate system:** Cartesian 3D printers are named after the Cartesian coordinate system that uses X, Y, and Z coordinates to plot points. This system of coordinates is used to determine the location of the nozzle. Cartesian 3D printers do this through a system of rails which are used to move the print head and the print bed to position the extruder anywhere in the 3D space.
