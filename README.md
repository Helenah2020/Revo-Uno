# Revo Uno
Revo Uno is a cartesian FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer. This 3D printer is very much like the Mendel 3D printer, the simplest printer to build, except this 3D printer has a frame consisting of a combination of box section and rods instead of just rods like the Mendel 3D printer, the advantage of this frame is you can hide the wiring inside the box section of the frame and force it to stay tidy and protect it from damage.

## Features
* Bowden extruder
* Cartesian coordinate system
* Metal frame consisting of a combination of box section and rods
