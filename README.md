Revo Uno is a cartesian FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer. This 3D printer is very much like the Mendel 3D printer, the simplest printer to build, except this 3D printer has a frame made from box section instead of rods which is useful for hiding wiring and keeping it tidy.

## Features
* Bowden extruder
* Cartesian coordinate system
* Metal frame made out of box section, the Mendel 3D printer uses rods for the frame, this one uses
