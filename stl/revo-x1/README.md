# Revo X1
**Revo X1** is a modular system which consists of the X carriage (Revo X1C1) and modules which are used for holding hot ends and firmly attaching them to the X carriage, the system was designed to provide a sleek solution which requires as little nuts and screws as possible, almost everything can be slotted together, each part is small footprint which reduces the amount of plastic required to print the parts. Each module has an arrow shaped key attached to the back of it which slots firmly into the front of the X carriage. This system has been designed to hold the weight of light weight components such as hold ends (heatsink, throat and nozzle) therefore it's highly advised that this system is incorporated into a Bowden system where the cold end (stepper motors and gears) are not on the X carriage.
