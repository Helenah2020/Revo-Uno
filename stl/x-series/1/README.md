# Revo X1
**Revo X1** is a modular system which consists of the X carriage and modules which are used for holding hot ends and firmly attaching them to the X carriage. Each module has an arrow shaped key attached to the back of it which slots firmly into the front of the X carriage. This system has been designed to hold the weight of light weight components such as hold ends (heatsink, throat and nozzle) therefore it's highly advised that this system is incorporated into a Bowden system where the cold end (stepper motors and gears) are not on the X carriage.
